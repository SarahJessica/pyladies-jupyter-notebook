    "    - in most simple cases it is good to use `__name__`\n",
    "3. the route `/index` is made.\n",
    "    - it is a decorator for what follows\n",

    "    ii. A view function\n",
    "        `@app.route('/index')`\n",
    "        `def index():\n",
    "            return 'Hello, World!'`\n",
    "    N.B. we could have called the `index()` function anything. It doesn't have to match the route name\n",
    "4. We can store our static assets in a static directory and access them using the `/static/` route."
